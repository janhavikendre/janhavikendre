# Hi, I'm Janhavi 👋  
**@janhavikendre**

I'm a 3rd-year Computer Science and Engineering student passionate about Full-Stack Web Development and AI-powered applications. I build projects using the **MERN stack** and have recently started exploring **Next.js**, **Web3**, and building chat apps, resume generators, and productivity tools. I'm also an active contributor to the #180DaysOfCode challenge, where I document my daily learning and development progress.

I'm curious, consistent, and always open to collaborating on meaningful ideas—whether it's a custom job portal, a crypto dashboard, or a Solana-based DApp.
